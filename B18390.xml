            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THese are to give Notice, That here is Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived an Experienced and most Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>High-German</hi> Doctor, who by his great Study, and constant Practice in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parts of the World, as well in Princes Courts, as in Hospitals, and War-like Expeditions, hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained such a Physical Method, as to Cure all exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and internal Distempers <hi>(if Curable,)</hi> and a great many he has cured when left off by others as incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; as he can shew by Testimonials not only from Emperors, Kings, Dukes, and Electoral Princes, but also from the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> with the Court of Aldermen. Also from the Right Worshipful Mayor and Aldermen of the City of <hi>Bristol, Worcester</hi> and <hi>Hereford,</hi> &amp;c. and many other Cities and Corporations in this Kingdom, certifying the great, many, speedy, and wonderful Cures he has undertaken, and (by Gods Blessing) most happily performed.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. He helps also all Bursten or Broken Bellies, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Men, Women or Children, whether the Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be in the Groin or Navel; and if the Rupture be as big as a Mans Head, then trust to God and his Art, and you shall have your Cure, that you may go about in a short time without a Truss, if you have been Bursten 20 or 30 years together. He also directeth Artificially all sorts of Trusses, so easie the like was never seen, the Patient may go in the same, and Ride, Dance and Spring, and do what they will without any Danger, which Medicine healeth artificially un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same. Of these Ruptures are found seven sorts, <hi>Hernia Intestinalis, Ventosa, Varicosa, Aq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="6">6. This Doctor hath a most rare way for the curing of the Kings-Evil, and Falling-Sickness in Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Children, if they have been troubled with it 10, or 20 years, so that they shall not be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with it again all their Life-time.</p>

            <p n="9">9.

            <p n="10">10. He would have no person despair by reason of the long continuance of their Distemper; but bring their Urine and he will give his Judgment in all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers, and resolve you whether your Disease be Curable or not; if Curable, he will undertake them; if not, he tells you so, that you may not be abused by False Pretenders; and will give you such satisfaction that you may see what an honest Physician for Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel and Physick can perform.</p>
            <p n="11">11. He keeps likewise an Operator that cleanses the Teeth and makes them as white as Ivory, and extracts Aching Teeth with a Touch, and gives pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent ease to those pained with hollow Teeth, and takes all the Scorbutical Humours out of the Gums, and fastens loose Teeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the Satisfaction of the Curious, shall be inserted on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly some few notable Cures (out of the many Hundreds might be mentioned) which have been wrought by this Famous</hi> High-German <hi>Doctor lately.</hi>
